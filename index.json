[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a Master’s Student in Mining and Minerals Engineering at TU Bergakademie Freiberg. Prior to this I worked with Kinross Gold Corporation within their technical services. Over the course of my master’s degree, I have worked as a Mining Engineer and Business Development intern with General Atomics Europe GmbH and also within the area of computational minerals engineering and analytics at the Helmholtz Institute Freiberg.\nI was also a visiting research scholar at Missouri University of Science and technology in the United States. I am interested in the application of technological methodologies to disentangle the complex interaction between mineral resource extraction, sustainability and Business, to advance our scientific understanding and forward these insights into optimizing industrial processes. To accomplish these goals, I draw upon computer science, mathematics, and mining engineering. I look forward to transferring the skills and expertise I will gain from these into the real-world.\nBesides research activities,I describe myself as a rabid “POLITIVIST”- part political, part activist. I believe that it isn’t too late to create a better world- One free of Human Rights abuse, Racism, or Fascism. In cognizance of these themes, I am actively involved with several organizations whose missions align with the aforementioned ones. One such organization is Amnesty international, Germany. Through them, I founded the local branch in Freiberg, Saxony. On a number of occasions, I have participated in panel discussions on Human Rights and Feminist movements. I am also involved with Saxony schools to help shape diversity and internationalization. In recent times, I have been with Progressive international, an organization which aims to unite, organize, and mobilize progressive forces worldwide for positive change, and other initiatives in Germany aimed at positively impacting communities as a whole. I talk about Politics a lot, and in particular global Foreign Policy.\nSince World War II, there has been a growing tendency to view foreign policy as a domestic policy tool. A more realistic, pragmatic, and proactive foreign policy must emerge. I label this as the “Total Foreign Policy System” (TFPS). The first principle of such a functioning system is secure and cumulative access to resources pursuant to the national interest. It is clear that foreign policy mistakes have been made, their effects being felt in recent years, but what are the most critical errors that need to be rectified? And what shall be the economic ramifications on domestic policies when such Total Foreign Policy Systems are implemented? Does Germany need such a “Total Foreign Policy System”? Does America need such a “Total Foreign Policy System”?

I found out about TUBAF during my search and was immediately convinced.\nYou won the DAAD award. How are you involved with international students?\nI have been part of the buddy program for new international students since my 2nd semester. I co-founded the Amnesty International university group and was its spokesperson. I also served on a committee of the Student Council (StuRa) and I helped organize the Festival of Cultures. Currently, I offer online consultations for students in my degree program as a tutor.\nWhat opportunities are there to get involved at the university?\nWithin the university, we are always looking for committed students to support the committee work in the StuRa and the FSRs. It is also possible to participate in the buddy program to support new international students. Additionally, there are working groups, clubs and initiatives within the university that are always looking for new members. Getting involved in these areas is a form of personal development and is very rewarding.\nWhat tip do you have for international students?\nDon’t be afraid to ask questions. There is a lot of support here. You can always contact the International University Center. Without its support, for example, I would not have been able to complete my second internship. The Career Center also supports international students and already invited us to a meeting to better understand our career needs and to work out new strategies. For me, TUBAF is a cosmopolitan place where international exchange and diversity of opinions are always in the first place, both in research and teaching.\nPress Release\nFacebook:\nInterview as reported on the Facebook page of TU Bergakademie Freiberg\nInstagram:\nInterview as reported on the Instagram page of TU Bergakademie Freiberg ","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"80b6071ecd93c2a509f43ac9f3efd2b6","permalink":"https://Duah-Philip.github.io/post/interview-daad-preis/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/interview-daad-preis/","section":"post","summary":"Q\u0026A with… …Philip Duah, Master student (Sustainable Mining and Remediation Management) from Ghana and DAAD award winner.\nWhy did you decide to study at TUBAF?\nMy goal was to attend a top mining university that places great emphasis on internationalization, is known for mining research and innovation, and where I can study and conduct research at the intersection of mining, technology, and sustainability.","tags":null,"title":"Interview with TU Bergakademie Freiberg","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"On the 18th of October, 2022 I was awarded the 2022 DAAD Prize at TU Bergakademie Freiberg.\nThe German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) via German Universities, every year, awards the DAAD Prize for outstanding achievements by international Students at German Universities.

Participants included the director of the University Graduate and Research Academy, Dr. Kristina Wopat, as well as student council members (StuRa), the Feminism Group, and the International Center’s working group for foreign students (AKAS).\nIn my brief presentation, I detailed my ambitions for Freiberg and the University. As the Founder, Spokesperson, and President of Amnesty International Freiberg, a human rights group comprising over forty students from 13 different countries studying and living in Freiberg, I mentioned that the university authorities must show their full solidarity at all times for minority students.\nThe rise of hate groups and right-wing extremists in Freiberg and the state (Saxony) in general warrants a safe space for people with migration backgrounds, refugees, Black people, and other minorities studying in the University. Taking a pragmatic approach to dealing with societal acceptance of minority students within the city will not be easy; however, in order to overcome societal challenges, collaboration, solidarity, and common ideas will be necessary.\nIn his remarks, the rector expressed his strong commitment to ensuring the well-being of international students. He stressed how important it is to him that students in Freiberg live in safety. A number of his encouraging pieces of advice focused on what to do if a student falls victim to abuse or attack within the city. We concluded the meeting by discussing the possibility of holding a student parliament. The purpose of this special event is to engage Germans and international students at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg in human rights discussions while fostering civil society engagement.\nPress Release: German Language version Press Release The meeting was featured in the press release of TU Bergakademie Freiberg\n","date":1567036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567036800,"objectID":"414caf62f42b08d9e3ed5d151f053961","permalink":"https://Duah-Philip.github.io/courses/getting-started/","publishdate":"2019-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/getting-started/","section":"courses","summary":"I honored the invitation of the Rector of TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Prof. Dr. Klaus-Dieter Barbknecht who is also the current chairman of the State Rectors' Conference of Saxony, Germany.","tags":["Academic","Amnesty"],"title":"Exchange With The Rector of TU Bergakademie Freiberg","type":"courses"},{"authors":["Duah Philip"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553644800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553644800,"objectID":"69425fb10d4db090cfbd46854715582c","permalink":"https://Duah-Philip.github.io/publication/conference-paper/","publishdate":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The fragment size distribution of blasted rock material is an imperative determinant of the economics associated with other mine operations.....","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Unraveling the Capability of Artificial Intelligence for Prediction of Rock Fragmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
